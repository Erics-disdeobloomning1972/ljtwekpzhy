Yo, so I just finished Honeymoon Crasher, and dude, what even was that? 😂 Like, I don’t even know if I should laugh or cry. There was this one bit where the bride was literally yelling, “I can’t believe this is my honeymoon!” and I’m like, girl, SAME! It's chaos, but in a kinda fun way? You know what I mean, like every rom-com ever but on steroids.

Anyway, I legit can’t believe I 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   just cuz everyone kept hyping it. Not gonna lie, it starts off kinda slow, but then it just hits you with these ridiculous plot twists. It’s like, come on, who writes this stuff? 

> Also, that main guy, the groom, is so awkward, it’s almost painful, but somehow he's relatable? Maybe it’s just me projecting, LOL. And the best friend character, she’s my spirit animal. Sarcasm level: expert. Wish I could snatch her energy for real life. 😂

Seriously though, there was this wild scene halfway through, and I'm just there thinking, “Are they even gonna get a honeymoon after all this crashing?” I kinda zoned out, daydreaming about drinking coffee on a beach somewhere. Maybe I’m the one who should 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again and pay more attention this time.

But hey, if you get bored tonight, give it a 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩. Maybe grab some popcorn or something. Let me know what you think, tho. I need someone to laugh about it with, so we can cringe together. 😂
